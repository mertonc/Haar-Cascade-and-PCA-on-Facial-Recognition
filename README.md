# Haar-Cascade-and-PCA-on-Facial-Recognition
This project runs several testing scenarios to understand how the Haar Cascade algorithm would perform under different conditions or how certain factor could impact its performance. Utilizes a sample photo database to test out how accurate the PCA algorithm can be when the conditions of the input training photos are relatively ideal.
